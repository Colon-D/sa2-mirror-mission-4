## What does it do?

By default, this mod flips the screen on the 4th Mission of most Levels. 🪞\
The controls also adjust to gravity. 🎮\
The Player will flip back to its original shape. 🦔

This was requested by [Luks_18](https://gamebanana.com/members/1732595)

This mod used [Justin113D](https://gamebanana.com/members/1661085)'s 
<u>[FlipScreen](https://gamebanana.com/mods/317917)</u> mod, to... flip the 
screen. 🙃

## What else can it do?

That not enough? Welp, there's options! 🤔

You can change the direction of the mirror, along with a rotation if wanted. 😵‍💫

You can change which Mission Numbers get mirrored. 1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣4️⃣5️⃣\
Route 101 and Route 208 have seperate options as they have different mission 
goals.🏎️\
You can try to mirror Chao World, but do not blame me when you see your Chao 
inside out. 😵

Are you a dumb hecking idiot who finds themselves wishing Tails and Eggman were
too? Mirror the Player on the X Axis then watch in horror whilst they stare
into your soul and proceed to shoot backwards. 🔫

## Incompatibilities 💔

The [FlipScreen](https://gamebanana.com/mods/317917) mod will **not** work, 
as both mods are trying to take control of the camera at the same place and 
time.\
Disable [FlipScreen](https://gamebanana.com/mods/317917) and use setting from 
my mod instead. All your favourite settings are here. Do not ask how, certainly
do not tell the police please I am begging you, sure I stole them but I gave
myself permission because I am kinda cringe tbh.

Also, my own mod
[Crazy Gadget: Camera rotates with Gravity](https://gamebanana.com/mods/352678)
will **not** work, for the same reason.\
I did try to get it to work, I failed, and I gave up. Give me a few weeks and 
I will combine both mods together I guess. That kinda sucks as a solution... 
perhaps I should create a third mod, one big monolithic catastrophe held 
together by duct tape and glue.
